# Ant Colony Sudoku
This repository contains a solver for the Sudoku Problem, which uses the bio-inspired Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The application has been created within the Operational Research classes held at the AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
It is necessary to have a `Java 1.8` distribution installed (or an equivalent one with the `JavaFX` library configured).
### Running
Compile Java sources and run the `pl.edu.agh.operationsresearch.common.AntColonySudoku` class. Then, use the GUI to insert input data and run the algorithm.
